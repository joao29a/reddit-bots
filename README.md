my reddit bots using [praw](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw)

The code could be a lot better, but I did this a year ago and I don't care.
* [Silver bot](https://github.com/joao29a/reddit-bots/tree/master/silver) - It gives [reddit silver](http://i.imgur.com/lXVJYnh.png) for that insightful comment.
* [Facts bot](https://github.com/joao29a/reddit-bots/tree/master/facts) - Post a comment with a random fact in a random post.
* [Good bot](https://github.com/joao29a/reddit-bots/tree/master/good) - Says 'Good.' on a random post. Very useful.
